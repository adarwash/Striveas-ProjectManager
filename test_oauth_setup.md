# Microsoft OAuth Integration - Setup Complete! üéâ

## What We've Built

I've successfully implemented a **Freshservice-style "Connect with Microsoft"** OAuth flow for your ticketing system! Here's what's now available:

### ‚úÖ **OAuth2 Authentication Flow**
- **One-click connection**: Users click "Connect with Microsoft" ‚Üí Microsoft login ‚Üí Grant permissions ‚Üí Automatically connected
- **Secure token storage**: Tokens are encrypted and stored in the database
- **Automatic token refresh**: Tokens refresh automatically when they expire
- **No passwords stored**: Using OAuth2 means no password storage needed

### üìÑ **New Files Created**

1. **`/app/controllers/MicrosoftAuth.php`**
   - Handles the OAuth flow (connect, callback, disconnect)
   - Manages token storage and refresh
   - Gets user information from Microsoft

2. **`/app/views/admin/email_settings_oauth.php`**
   - Beautiful UI for email settings
   - "Connect with Microsoft" button
   - Connection status display
   - App registration configuration
   - Email processing settings

### üîß **How to Access the New Email Settings**

There are **TWO ways** to access the email settings page:

#### **Option 1: Direct Link from Admin Dashboard**
1. Go to `/admin`
2. Look for the **"Email Settings"** card (with envelope icon)
3. Click on it to go directly to the OAuth configuration

#### **Option 2: Through System Settings**
1. Go to `/admin/settings`
2. Click on the **"Email"** tab
3. You'll see a prominent blue card for **"Microsoft 365 Email Integration"**
4. Click the **"Configure Now"** button

### üöÄ **How to Set It Up**

   - Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
   - Navigate to Azure Active Directory ‚Üí App registrations
   - Click "New registration"
   - Name: "ProjectTracker Email Integration"
   - Redirect URI: `http://localhost/microsoftAuth/callback` (or your domain)

   - API permissions ‚Üí Add permission ‚Üí Microsoft Graph
   - Add these delegated permissions:
     - `Mail.Read`
     - `Mail.Send`
     - `Mail.ReadWrite`
     - `User.Read`
     - `offline_access`

3. **Create client secret:**
   - Certificates & secrets ‚Üí New client secret
   - Copy the value immediately (won't be shown again)

4. **Enter credentials in ProjectTracker:**
   - Go to `/admin/emailSettings`
   - Enter your Application (Client) ID
   - Enter your Client Secret
   - Optionally enter Tenant ID (or leave as "common")
   - Click "Save Configuration"

5. **Connect your account:**

### üîê **Security Features**

### üìß **What Happens Next**

Once connected, the system will:
1. Automatically check for new emails in your inbox
2. Convert emails to tickets
3. Send auto-replies if configured
4. Track email threads and replies
5. Handle attachments

### üõ†Ô∏è **Integration with Existing System**

The OAuth system integrates seamlessly with:
