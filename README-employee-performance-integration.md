# Employee Performance Integration with Time Tracking

## Overview

This integration combines the existing Employee Management system with Time Tracking data to provide comprehensive employee performance analytics. Admins and managers can now view detailed performance metrics that include both traditional performance ratings and time-based analytics.

## Features

### ðŸŽ¯ **Performance Dashboard** (`/employees/performance`)
- **Comprehensive Overview**: View all employees with integrated time tracking performance metrics
- **Real-time Status**: See current clock-in status of all employees  
- **Performance Analytics**: Combined scoring based on:
  - Traditional performance rating (1-5 scale)
  - Time tracking productivity rating (Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair, Needs Improvement)
  - Punctuality score (percentage of on-time arrivals)
  - Attendance rate (days worked vs expected working days)
  - Consistency score (how consistent working hours are)

### ðŸ“Š **Detailed Performance Analysis** (`/employees/performance?user_id=X`)
- **Individual Employee Deep Dive**: Comprehensive analysis for specific employees
- **Time Tracking Metrics**: 
  - Total hours worked (configurable period: 7, 30, 60, 90 days)
  - Average hours per day
  - Break efficiency analysis
  - Daily time tracking history with performance indicators
- **Visual Analytics**: Progress bars, badges, and color-coded performance indicators
- **Current Status**: Real-time view of employee's current activity (clocked in, on break, clocked out)

### ðŸ“ˆ **Performance Metrics Calculated**

#### **Productivity Rating Algorithm**
The system calculates an overall productivity rating based on:
- **Hours per Day** (25 points): 7.5+ hours = 25pts, 6+ hours = 20pts, 4+ hours = 15pts
- **Punctuality** (25 points): 90%+ = 25pts, 80%+ = 20pts, 70%+ = 15pts  
- **Consistency** (25 points): 80%+ = 25pts, 60%+ = 20pts
- **Attendance** (25 points): 95%+ = 25pts, 85%+ = 20pts, 75%+ = 15pts

**Total Score**:
- 90+ = Excellent
- 75+ = Very Good  
- 60+ = Good
- 45+ = Fair
- <45 = Needs Improvement

#### **Key Performance Indicators**
1. **Punctuality Score**: % of days employee arrives by 9:00 AM
2. **Attendance Rate**: Days worked vs expected working days (Mon-Fri)
3. **Consistency Score**: How consistent daily working hours are (lower variance = higher score)
4. **Break Efficiency**: 
   - â‰¤15% of total time = Excellent
   - â‰¤25% of total time = Good  
   - >25% = Needs Improvement

## Technical Implementation

### Database Integration
- **No New Tables Required**: Uses existing `TimeEntries`, `TimeBreaks`, and `EmployeeManagement` tables
- **SQL Server Compatible**: All queries use SQL Server syntax (`GETDATE()`, `DATEPART()`, etc.)
- **Efficient Queries**: Optimized for performance with proper indexing

### Model Enhancements (`app/models/Employee.php`)
```php
// New methods added:
getEmployeePerformanceWithTimeTracking($userId, $days)
getAllEmployeesWithTimeTrackingPerformance($days, $sortBy)
getTimeTrackingPerformanceSummary($days)
calculateTimePerformanceMetrics($userId, $startDate, $endDate)
getDailyTimeTracking($userId, $startDate, $endDate)
```

### Controller Enhancements (`app/controllers/Employees.php`)
```php
// New methods added:
performance()                    // Main dashboard and detail views
getTimeAnalytics($userId)       // AJAX endpoint for dynamic data
exportPerformanceReport()       // CSV export functionality
updatePerformanceRating($userId) // Quick rating updates
```
