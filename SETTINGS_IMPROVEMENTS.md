# Settings Page and Admin Panel Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the improvements made to the settings page and admin panel to resolve overlapping functions, improve layout consistency, and create a seamless user experience.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Settings Controller Access Problem**
**Issue**: All users (including regular users) were being redirected to admin settings, which was inappropriate for non-admin users.

**Solution**: 
- Modified the Settings controller to check user permissions
- Admin users are redirected to `/admin/settings` for system-wide settings
- Regular users see a personal settings page at `/settings`
- Created proper role-based access control

### 2. **Missing User Settings Interface**
**Issue**: No dedicated settings page existed for regular users.

**Solution**:
- Created `/app/views/settings/index.php` with comprehensive user settings interface
- Organized settings into logical tabs: Profile, Preferences, Notifications, Security
- Responsive design with consistent UI elements

### 3. **Admin Panel Layout Improvements**
**Issue**: Admin panel had redundant navigation and unclear separation of functions.

**Solution**:
- Improved `/app/views/admin/index.php` with clearer navigation
- Separated Email Settings from System Settings for better organization
- Added proper breadcrumbs and navigation flow
- Enhanced visual hierarchy with better icons and descriptions

### 4. **Duplicated Functions Elimination**
**Issue**: Similar functions existed in multiple places with inconsistent implementation.

**Solution**:
- Consolidated settings management in the Settings controller
