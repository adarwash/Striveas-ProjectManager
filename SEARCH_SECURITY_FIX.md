# Critical Search Security Fix

## Issue Description

**CRITICAL SECURITY BUG**: The universal search was showing other users' notes in search results, violating data privacy and security.

### Root Cause

The issue was caused by overly permissive fallback permissions in the search system:

1. **Overpermissive Role Mapping**: The fallback permission system was granting `notes.read` permission to ALL user roles (user, employee, supervisor, team_lead)
2. **Broad Permission Scope**: The `notes.read` permission was designed to allow viewing ALL notes system-wide, not just user's own notes
3. **Database-Level Security Gap**: The Note model's search method returned all matching notes without user filtering

## Security Impact

- **Data Breach**: Users could see titles, content, and metadata of notes created by other users
- **Privacy Violation**: Personal and project-specific notes were exposed across user boundaries
- **Compliance Risk**: Potential violation of data protection regulations

## Fix Implementation

### 1. Restricted Permission Mapping

**Before:**
```php
$rolePermissions = [
    'user' => ['tasks.read', 'notes.read'],           // ❌ Too permissive
    'employee' => ['projects.read', 'tasks.read', 'users.read', 'notes.read'],  // ❌ Too permissive
    'supervisor' => ['projects.read', 'tasks.read', 'users.read', 'clients.read', 'notes.read', 'reports_read'],  // ❌ Too permissive
    'team_lead' => ['projects.read', 'tasks.read', 'users.read', 'notes.read']  // ❌ Too permissive
];
```

**After:**
```php
$rolePermissions = [
    'user' => ['tasks.read'],                         // ✅ No broad notes access
    'employee' => ['projects.read', 'tasks.read'],   // ✅ No broad notes access
    'supervisor' => ['projects.read', 'tasks.read', 'users.read', 'clients.read', 'reports_read'], // ✅ No broad notes access
    'team_lead' => ['projects.read', 'tasks.read', 'users.read'] // ✅ No broad notes access
];
```

### 2. Enhanced Search Entity Access

**Before:**
```php
case 'notes':
    return hasSearchPermission('notes.read') || isManager();  // ❌ Too restrictive for own notes
```

**After:**
```php
case 'notes':
    // Users can always search notes (they'll only see their own unless they have notes.read permission)
    return true;  // ✅ Allow searching, filtering happens at item level
```

### 3. Database-Level Security (Defense in Depth)

**Added secure search method:**
```php
public function searchNotesSecure($searchQuery, $userId, $hasFullAccess = false, $limit = 10) {
    $whereClause = "(n.title LIKE ? OR n.content LIKE ?)";
    
    // If user doesn't have full access, only show their own notes
    if (!$hasFullAccess) {
        $whereClause .= " AND n.created_by = ?";
        $params[] = $userId;
    }
    // ... rest of query
}
```

### 4. Enhanced Controller Logic

**Updated search controller:**
```php
$userId = $_SESSION['user_id'];
$hasFullNotesAccess = hasSearchPermission('notes.read') || isManager();

// Use secure search method that filters at database level
$notes = $this->noteModel->searchNotesSecure($searchQuery, $userId, $hasFullNotesAccess, $limit);

// Double-check permission (defense in depth)
if ($this->canViewItem($note, 'notes')) {
    // Add to results
}
```

## Permission Model

### Notes Access Levels

| Role | Own Notes | All Notes |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| User | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Employee | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Supervisor | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Team Lead | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Admin | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Manager | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |

### Permission Requirements

- **Own Notes**: No special permission required (ownership-based access)
- **All Notes**: Requires explicit `notes.read` permission (admin/manager only)

## Security Measures Implemented

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users only get access to their own notes by default
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security checks
3. **Database-Level Filtering**: Secure queries that filter at the SQL level
4. **Permission Validation**: Double-checking permissions in controller
5. **Audit Trail**: All search activities are logged for security monitoring

## Testing

### Verify Fix

1. **Test as Regular User**: Search should only return user's own notes
2. **Test as Admin**: Search should return all notes
3. **Test Permission Debug**: Use `/search/permissions` to verify role permissions
4. **Test Cross-User**: Verify User A cannot see User B's notes

### Test Commands

```bash
# Test user permissions
curl -X GET "/search/permissions" --cookie "session_cookie"

# Test note search
curl -X GET "/search?q=test&type=notes" --cookie "session_cookie"
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Granular Note Permissions**: Team-based note sharing
2. **Note Categories**: Public vs private note classifications
3. **Audit Logging**: Enhanced logging for note access attempts
4. **Field-Level Security**: Sensitive field masking in search results

## Compliance Notes

This fix addresses:
- Data privacy requirements
- Need-to-know access principles
- Audit trail requirements
- Principle of least privilege

The system now provides enterprise-grade security for note data while maintaining usability for legitimate access patterns.
